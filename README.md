Basic rider registration system for HÃ¼ttcross cyclocross race series.

We've been wrangling paper a lot for the last while and it's getting annoying and slow, as there are so many more people keen to race than ever before.
So we would like to try something using a basic Android tab with fields for the riders details (as below) that can be saved into a file to transfer to the timing system.

I'm using Cordova to do this. I have some familiarity with it but haven't used it from scratch and haven't saved info to a file before. Most of my time is going into setup.
It'll be really useful if I can get it working!

* take rider names
* take rider number
* take rider grade
* display waiver for rider to agree to
* save rider detils to file to be transferred to timing system (.csv, .xls etc)
